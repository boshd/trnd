# TRND - Social Network for GIFs

## Features

Lesa shwaya..

## How to run the app
Follow these steps:

### Connect Parse to server

Since Parse was open-sourced and officialy depricated, you'll need to setup a server using services like AWS, Heroku, etc.
Choose the service of your choosing and replace all the information in the ParseServer.swift file and you should be set.

### Run
1. Open the trnd.xcworkspace in Xcode.

Note before last step:<i> if you don't have cocoapods installed on your computer, you have to install it first. You can do it by opening the terminal and running "sudo gem install cocoapods". If you already have cocoapods installed, ignore this note.</i>

2. Open the terminal, navigate to project folder and run "pod update".


## Compatibility
TRND is written in Swift 4.2 and requires iOS 12.0 or later.
